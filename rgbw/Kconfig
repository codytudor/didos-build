          This option enables RGBW support and can
          be configured via sysfs. If unsure, say N.

          This sets up the class to accept platform devices of this 
          class. The generic driver requires this class to be in the
          kernel before it can be added.

          This driver adds support for configuring and driving a generic 
          RGB[W] LED Light Strip peripheral. This driver requires a 
          minimum  of three PWM OR GPIO channels with an optional fourth 
          driving the white channel. This driver is specific to the i.MX6 
          family of GPIO/PWM drivers.
